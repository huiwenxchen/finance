# finance

Finance is a Flask web app that allows users to register for an account, query real stocksâ€™ actual prices (data from IEX) and the value of stocks owned, and conduct transactions (buy and sell stocks). I generated a database on the backend using SQLite to store account and stocks information, transaction history, and each user's stocks portfolio. 


To run this program, ensure that you have all requirements in requirements.txt. 

Run the command flask run in your terminal.
